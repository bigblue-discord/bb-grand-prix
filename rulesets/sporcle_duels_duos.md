# Ruleset
1. Two persons per team - teams are chosen randomly and remain consistent through the entirety of the tourney
2. First to 5
3. Spellcheck is allowed, but you can only use the built-in browser spell check. 
4. One player must stream their screen while completing the quiz. The other player may not avert their eyes from the streaming player's stream and the streaming player cannot avert their eyes from the quiz (basically don't do stupid tryhard things like having a pdf dictionary on your other monitor or browsing wikipedia on your phone)
5. If it the first match of the set, teams RPS for first pick. For subsequent Rounds, the loser of the prior round gets first pick.
6. Click "random quiz" on the top right of the [sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/) website
7. Your team is allowed up to two reroll if you do not want to do the drawn quiz. If you run out of reroll, your team *must* do the rerolled quiz. You can skip minefield quizes with no restrictions
8. All members of the voice chat must mute except for the team currently playing during a quiz. They can type in a thread which the currently playing team will be removed from.
9. Score is determined by the persentage score on the quiz, multiplied by a "time bonus." The time bonus is `10*{Time Taken}/{Time allotted}` and you get it _even_ if you give up early. For example, if your quiz allowed 20 minutes and you give up with a 60% score 10 minutes in because you don't think you can fill out more of the quiz, you get score of 65 since `60 + (10*(10/20)) = 65`.
10. Which ever team has the higher score wins the match.

## Settling Ties
In case of tie, no team wins a point towards the set
